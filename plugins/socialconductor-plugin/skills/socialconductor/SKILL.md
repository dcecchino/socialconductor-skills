# SocialConductor — Facebook, Instagram, YouTube & TikTok

Control your SocialConductor AI comment bots from WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, or iMessage.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Dashboard |
|----------|--------|-----------| 
| 👥 Facebook / Instagram | ✅ Live | podium.socialconductor.ai |
| 📺 YouTube | ✅ Live | studio.socialconductor.ai |
| 🎵 TikTok | ✅ Live | violin.socialconductor.ai |

Each platform uses its own API key. You can connect one, two, or all three —
commands are prefixed by platform so OpenClaw always knows which bot you mean.

## Auth & Privacy

**API Keys:** The environment variables (`SC_FB_API_KEY`, `SC_YT_API_KEY`, `SC_TIKTOK_API_KEY`) are **SocialConductor-issued API keys** generated from your SocialConductor dashboard. They are *not* your native Meta, Google, or TikTok passwords or OAuth tokens. You only need to provide the keys for the specific platforms you wish to automate.

**Registration & Data Privacy:** When you run a `connect` command, OpenClaw sends only a secure, anonymous identifier (`{"openclaw_user_id": "..."}`) to the SocialConductor API via `POST /api/openclaw/register` to generate your one-time browser link. **No chat history, personal data, or agent context is transmitted during this registration phase.**

Tokens are stored locally by OpenClaw and sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every call. Keys are SHA-256 hashed before server-side storage — the plaintext is never saved remotely.

| Platform | Register endpoint |
|----------|-------------------|
| Facebook / Instagram | https://podium.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
| YouTube | https://studio.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
| TikTok | https://violin.socialconductor.ai/api/openclaw/register |
